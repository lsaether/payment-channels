# Payment Channels

The code demonstrates the most basic form of a payment channel and how
it would be implemented using the Substrate blockchain framework. The code
is heavily documented so can be read through by a beginner of the Substrate
framework and understood.

If you would like to contribute the repository could use some tests!
